<h1>nrTEST</h1>
<p>This page needs work but here's the gist of what you need to know.</p>
<p>The test program is in <code>tests/nrTEST</code></p>
<p>If you have cloned the repository and you cd into tests, then you can run:</p>
<pre><code>NUMEROUSAPIKEY=~/.numerous ./nrTEST -D
</code></pre>
<p>The "-D" flag will make the test program execute using the local numerous.py library (in .. from the tests directory) and the local nr.py shell command (in ../shell-cmd from the tests directory) and it will run the tests twice - first with python version 2 and then with python version 3. </p>
<p>You can use the "-Q" flag to run "quick". It's not really quick but it does skip a few of the more time-intensive tests. The arg parsing is a simple sh hack and you can't say "-QD" you have to say "-Q -D" if you want both.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>It might be best to have a Numerous API Key for a "test" account because this will end up making a lot of metrics in the account during the test (though it does try to clean them up; frankly I just use my normal account and every now and then I just have to clean it up by hand if the test went awry).</p>
