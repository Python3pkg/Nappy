# NumerousApp Python API

This class implements the NumerousApp API in python. You can read and write metrics ("numbers" you have set up in Numerous), create comments on metrics, access metric event streams, delete metrics, change your subscriptions, etc.

Also there is a Unix/Linux [shell command](https://github.com/outofmbufs/Nappy/wiki/Shell-Command) "nr" that gives you command-line access to most functions of the NumerousApp APIs.

The code works in either major version (2.x or 3.x) of python.
