    # If m is a metric, then m[key] accesses a locally cached copy.
    # The server will be contacted if necessary (e.g., the first time any
    # field is accessed) but whenever possible the last known values
    # obtained from the server will be used.
    #
    # Thus, for example:
    #
    #    x = m['value']
    #    x = m.read()
    #
    # both put the value into x. However, the read() method contacts the
    # server every time whereas the [] method only contacts the server
    # once and saves a local copy of the data.
    #
    # The NumerousMetric class maintains cache consistency if you are the
    # only writer of the metric. That is:
    #
    #     m.write(9)
    #     nine = m['value']
    #     m.write(10)
    #     ten = m['value']
    #
    # will correctly result in nine==9, ten==10. But there is no cache
    # consistency maintained if there are other people writing the metric
    # behind your back, nor is there consistency across different objects:
    #
    #    id = '123123123123'
    #    m1 = nr.metric(id)
    #    m2 = nr.metric(id)
    #
    #    x = m1['value']
    #    m2.write(x+1)
    #    x = m1['value']
    #
    # x will have the old/stale value at this point. So don't access a single
    # metric via multiple objects, or always use read() if you must.
    #
    # No __setitem__ is implemented. That seemed fraught with peril though the
    # mapping from __setitem__ into write() and update() calls is quite
    # obvious. [ or the mapping to "update a local cache copy and
    # eventually have a commit() ]
    #
    # If you specify a non-existent key you will see a KeyError exception. You
    # will also potentially still cause a server interaction if there
    # is no cache.

    #    if we truly got spanked with "Too Many Requests"
    #    then delay the amount of time the server told us to delay.
    #
    # The arguments supplied to us are:
    #     nr is the Numerous
    #     tparams is a dictionary containing:
    #         'attempt'        : the attempt number. Zero on the very first try
    #         'rate-remaining' : X-Rate-Limit-Remaining reported by the server
    #         'rate-reset'     : time (in seconds) until fresh rate granted
    #         'result-code'    : HTTP code from server (e.g., 409, 200, etc)
    #         'resp'           : the full-on response object
    #         'request'        : information about the original request
    #         'debug'          : current debug level
    #     td is data supplied as "throttleData" to the Numerous() constructor
    #     up is a tuple useful for calling the original system throttle policy:
    #          up[0] is the function pointer
    #          up[1] is the td for *that* function
    #          up[2] is the "up" for calling *that* function
    #       ... so after you do your own thing if you then want to defer to the
    #           built-in throttle policy you can
    #                     return up[0](nr, tparams, up[1], up[2])
    #
    # It's really (really really) important to understand the return value and
    # the fact that we are invoked AFTER each request:
    #    False : simply means "don't do more retries". It does not imply
    #            anything about the success or failure of the request; it
    #            simply means this most recent request (response) is the
    #            one to "take" as the final answer
    #
    #    True  : means that the response is, indeed, to be interpreted as some
    #            sort of rate-limit failure and should be discarded. The
    #            original request will be sent again. Obviously it's a very
    #            bad idea to return True in cases where the server might
    #            have done anything non-idempotent.

    # A note about duplicate filtering, _filterDuplicates, etc.
    #
    # There is a bug in the NumerousApp server which can cause collections
    # to show duplicates of certain events (or interactions/stream items).
    # Explaining the bug in great detail is beyond the scope here; suffice
    # to say it only happens for events that were nearly-simultaneous
    # and happen to be getting reported right at a chunking boundary.
    #
    # The ChunkedAPIIter code filters out these bogus duplicates by default.
    # Each time it is about to return an item it checks to see if it returned
    # that same item previously (dupFilter['prev']). If it has, it skips that
    # duplicate one and gets another (and another, and another... as needed).
    #
    # Pragmatically it seems extremely unlikely that duplicates could span
    # multiple chunks. The chunk size is 100 and the most duplicates I've been
    # able to artificially manufacture with test cases is 4. The server simply
    # can't process that many "simultaneous" updates on the writing side (where
    # the condition for the duplicates in the result stream gets created).
    #
    # Because event streams certainly CAN (and DO) grow to be quite
    # large, I was concerned about the overall O[] cost of this filtering.
    # Therefore, the code only keeps track of the "previous" and "current"
    # IDs based on chunk boundaries. This puts an upper bound on the cost
    # of the algorithm for large event streams - the cost tops out based
    # on the chunk size not the total stream size. As long as there are
    # never more than 100 adjacent duplicates in a chunk this works
    # (reiterating: never seen more than 4, and server performance is
    # a pragmatic limit). There is no doubt this still slows things down
    # but really it's hard to imagine that it matters much.
    #
    # The flag for turning off duplicate filtering is really meant for testing.
    #
    # Note that not all of the APIs are susceptible to the bug so not all
    # of them contain the 'dupFilter' in their API info and thus sometimes
    # self.__dupfilter is None even if nr._filterDuplicates is True.

# EXCEPTIONS
#
#    NumerousError
#       - general errors
#
#    NumerousMetricConflictError
#       - you attempted an onlyIf metric write and the value was no change
#         Also raised for some metricByLabel duplicate match situations.
#
#    NumerousChunkingError
#       - something went wrong while fetching the next chunk in
#         an iterator for a collection such as the Stream, or Interactions,
#         or similar. If for example the metric got deleted while you were
#         in an iteration you might see this
#
#    NumerousAuthError
#       - your creds are no good
#
#    NumerousNetworkError
#       - there was a "somewhat normal" network error. The library catches the
#         lower level (requests.execptions) errors that you might get if
#         the network is down, connection times out, that sort of thing, and
#         translates them into this error (so you can catch it without
#         being exposed to the complexity that is all this lower-level
#         gobbledygook). In this case the details attribute will contain
#         the underlying exception info.

# numerousKey() - helper to implement common ways to specify the API Key
#


# numerousKey()
#
# I found this a good way to handle supplying the API key so it's here
# as a class method you may find useful. What this function does is
# return you an API Key from a supplied string or "readable" object:
#
#          a "naked" API key (in which case this function is a no-op)
#          @-        :: meaning "get it from stdin"
#          @blah     :: meaning "get it from the file "blah"
#          /blah     :: get it from file /blah
#          .blah     :: get it from file .blah (could be ../ etc)
#        /readable/  :: if it has a .read method, get it that way
#          None      :: get it from environment variable NUMEROUSAPIKEY
#
# Where the "it" that is being gotten from any of those sources can be:
#    a "naked" API key
#    a JSON object, from which the credsAPIKey will be used to get the key
#
# Arguably this doesn't belong here, but it's helpful. Purists are free to
# ignore it or delete from their own tree :)
