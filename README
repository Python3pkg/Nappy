Python class implementing the NumerousApp APIs.

DEPENDENCIES:

  * python3 (developed/tested on python3)
  * requests library

INSTALLING/USING:

Typically you install this in ~/lib (or somewhere in your PYTHONPATH).

Here is a "hello world" example:

   from numerous import Numerous

   MyKey = "nmrs_3Vblahblah"         # your personal NumerousApp API key
   MyMetric = "5746205777638039629"  # ID of a metric you have access to

   nr = Numerous(apiKey=MyKey)
   metric = nr.metric(MyMetric)

   print (metric.read())

LANG / Unicode Note:
-------------------

Note: if your LANG is set to C locale (default on some systems) you may 
see an ascii encoding exception from python when handling any metric names 
that have Unicode characters in them (or "..." that shows up in some places)

Set LANG appropriately, e.g.:

     LANG=en_US.UTF-8   # or similar as appropriate
